          1. What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?
        </p>
        <p class="ans">
          localStorage is a type of web storage object available in HTML 5 that
          allows storing data with no expiration date. In contrast,
          sessionStorage is a type of web storage object available in HTML 5
          that allows storing data for one session. The main difference between
          localStorage and sessionStorage is that the localStorage stores data
          with no expiration date, while the sessionStorage stores data from one
          session.

          2. What is the difference between Global Scope and Block Scope?
        </p>
        <p class="ans">
          The Global scope: If a variable is declared outside all functions or
          curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables
          can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside
          blocks.
          <br />
          The Block scope: he variables that are declared within the block scope
          are comparable to local ones. They are available within the block that
          they are defined.
          <br />
          The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that
          the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a
          new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the
          variables are still in the same scope.

        <p class="que">3. How Event loop works?</p>
        <p class="ans">
          Event Loop : The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's
          asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single
          thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the
          illusion of multi-threading.
          <br />
          Easy Definition : The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the
          Call Stack and the Callback Queue or Message Queue.
          <br />
          If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the
          Callback queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively
          runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each
          event is just a function callback.

          8 ways to get Undefine : <br />
          1. Variable that is not initialized will give undefined. <br />2.
          Function with no return.<br />
          3. Parameter that is not passed will be 'undefined.<br />
          4. If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined.<br />
          5. Property that doesn't exists on an object will give you
          undefined.<br />
          6. Accessing array elements outside of the index range.<br />
          7. Deleting an element inside an array.<br />
          8. Set a value directly to undefined.
